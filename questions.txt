So for this problem:
- Make a graph with the words. Words will be the nodes, and there will be an edge between two nodes if there's one letter of difference. I suggest creating a matrix for this graph.
- Do a Bredth-First search of this graph starting by the initial word.
- If a path from beginning to end is possible, you'll get to the final word in the shortest path possible.

for encoding that {a,b,c,...,z}<->{1,2,3,...,26}
if given a list of digit e.g. [1,2,3], this may represent {1,2,3}->{a,b,c} or {12,3}->{l,c} or {1,23}->{a,w}. so there are 3 possible interpretations for list [1,2,3]
so, given a list of digit, calculate the number of possible interpretations for the list.

- The first question is two find the largest and second largest value at each level of a binary tree. You don't need to return all values, just print out instead. the second question is to return a value in an array with the probability proportional to the weight of the value within the array.

3. Note: Copied this question from Glassdoor. I was asked the same question.
You have an unsorted array of integers and a function........string getCategory(integer)........which deterministically returns 1 of three possible strings: "low", "medium", or "high", depending on the input integer. You need to output an array with all the "low" numbers at the bottom, all the "medium" numbers in the middle, and all the "high" numbers at the top. This is basically a partial sort. Within each category, the order of the numbers does not matter...For example, you might be give the array [5,7,2,9,1,14,12,10,5,3]. For input integers 1 - 3, getCategory(integer) returns "low", for 4 - 10 it returns "medium," and for 11 - 15 it returns "high". You could output an array (or modify the given array) that looks like this: [3,1,2,5,5,9,7,10,14,12]

- Design the Google search bar that prompts you with suggestions as you type in it. These suggestions are not personalized but based on most popular queries in the past by all Google users. e.g. as you type "Fac" in the search bar the drop down prompts you with "Facebook" or "Facts about Great Britain" and so on based on recent most popular queries. Once designed, optimize this based on feedback from the interviewer (e.g. most users don't see the suggestions within 3 seconds and Google management is complaining about the lack of performance. How will you debug and fix it?)
